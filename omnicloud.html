                    <p class="project-step">Overview</p>
                    <h4 class="project-title">Problem</h4>
                    <p>Cloud storage apps are known for securely storing
                        digital assets such as photos and
                        documents.
                        But
                        what if you wanted to create and store your morning
                        to-do list? Wouldn’t it be easier if
                        you
                        could
                        create that list all in one app? While there are some
                        apps that lets users edit and share
                        files,
                        other can become overwhelmed and get lost in the app.</p>

                    <h4 class="project-title">Solution</h4>
                    <p>OmniCloud aims to address these concerns by bringing
                        these features together in a simple,
                        no-frills layout. Our major design challenge was to
                        offer users a way to jot down notes,
                        store files, and share ideas in one place. Users
                        wouldn’t have to jump from one app to another.

                        Keeping the client’s requests in mind, I explored the
                        requirements’ favorability in the
                        market
                        through user research. The design process was built on
                        consistent feedback as it focused on
                        bridging the desires of stakeholders and the needs of
                        users.</p>

                        <p>After capturing a picture of the competitive landscape, I wanted to understand what users thought about cloud
                            storage
                            apps
                            by creating a survey with the following goals:</p>

                            <li>To capture users’ general thoughts on cloud storage apps </li>

                        <p class="margin-top">While these findings were helpful, I have only scratched the surface. It was time to dig deeper and ask: who
                            really
                            are
                            these users? What value do they get from using these cloud storage apps?</p>

                        <p>To understand our users better, I interviewed three individuals about themselves, their daily habits, and their
                            experiences with cloud storage apps. The interview style was largely open-ended.</p>

                        <p>The pattern that emerged from the interviews was their need to have their files synchronized and accessible in
                            both
                            desktop and mobile. While one did not care for collaboration features, others thought it would be great if it
                            were
                            kept
                            simpler than Google Docs. These insights helped me discover two types of users: the casual user and the expert.
                            The
                            casual user uses one to two main features such as uploading photos, while the expert uses multiple features such
                            as
                            editing and collaborating on files. These findings were laid out into the following personas:

                                    I realized that the expert user would not only benefit from basic cloud storage app features, but would also
                                    prefer
                                    to
                                    connect with others for real-time collaboration on projects. Given that only a few cloud storage apps offer
                                    this
                                    set

                        <p>To visualize these processes, I sketched user flows for items in high priority. I aimed to simplify these stories by
                            keeping familiar flows. The onboarding process, for example, has been a target of complaints by survey responders. To
                            simplify this, I gave users the option of signing up with their Google and Facebook accounts.</p>

                            viable product (MVP). The primary pages are the landing page and the dashboard. Other core features such as logins

                            Testers were tasked to do three tasks: signing up for an account, adding a piece of content, and organizing content.
                            Overall, the users found the tasks to be simple and straightforward. A few suggestions came up about adding a
                            tutorial
                            and other convenient interactions such as clicking-and-dragging items into a folder.</p>

                        <p>Before sketching page layouts, I decided to work on the brand identity to figure out the hierarchy of elements and
                            sprinkle
                            content throughout the site. </p>
                     

                        <p>
                            <strong>The origin of the name OmniCloud:</strong>
                            The current ideas for the cloud storage app lean toward becoming a base for storing, creating, customizing and
                            sharing
                            files.
                            Thinking about the words versatility and boundless to describe this app’s capabilities, I searched for words with a
                            similar
                            meaning. There, I discovered the prefix omni meaning “all” and combined it with the nature of this project, the cloud
                            storage
                            app.</p>

                        <p>The name “OmniCloud” could remind someone of the word “omnipotent”, which is often used to describe an all-powerful
                            deity, or
                            “omnificent”, which describes one with unlimited creative power. To describe something of such high regard is to
                            equate
                            it
                            with something robust, reliable and secure. </p>

                        <p>Keeping this and my research findings in mind, I have developed the following:</p>

                        <p>When I thought of the name OmniCloud, I envisioned a sleek and modern logo with nodes, vortexes, and webs to depict
                            the
                            networks OmniCloud can reach through sharing and collaboration. </p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Ultimately, I decided to piece sets of ellipses together and included a logotype with a
                            futuristic font and dual-color
                            scheme. These details reflect OmniCloud’s expertise, professionalism, and openness to evolve as a modern cloud
                            storage
                            application. </p>

                        <p>To further assist users in feeling the sense of professionalism, robustness, and reliability, the following color

                            and typography were selected. For more details, check out the OmniCloud Style Guide. </p>

                        <p>With feedback gathered about layouts and additional features, I developed high-fidelity mockups for both desktop and
                            mobile views with Sketch and InVision. Using the style guide, I first built a design system to maintain consistency
                            across patterns and elements throughout the site.</p>

                        <p>I conducted the first round of usability tests on three individuals. I asked them to not only sign up for a new
                            account,
                            add content, and organize items, but to also share files and add collaborators. Here were the most notable
                            suggestions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Did not like having the sign up modal on another blank page</li>
                            <li>Instead of adding a gray overlay on selected files, add ellipses to encourage users to seek more options</li>
                            <li>Menu for mobile looks confusing when it is scattered; stacking it like the file menu window might help with
                                legibility</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Users were also asked about their general opinions of OmniCloud, its brand and whether they would be motivated to use
                            the
                            app in the future. They felt that the app was simple, intuitive, and professional. Some remarked that they would not
                            need
                            to use the text editor, but would use the app to store files such as photos from their devices. Others who found the
                            editing features helpful would intend on using it again in the future.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h5 class="project-section">3rd Round of Testing: Preferences for Style and Function</h5>
                        <p>Taking recent suggestions into consideration, I revised parts of the OmniCloud desktop and mobile mockups and
                            conducted
                            another usability test to determine what new users preferred. Using UsabilityHub, I sent out a brief preference test with the
                            following design comparisons:</p>
                        <div>
                            <img src="assets/images/results-settings.png" alt="Preference test - settings">
                            <p><strong>Results: Settings</strong></p>
                            <p>Over 60% preferred to have the settings icons on the top right of the dashboard. The thought that it was more
                                intuitive and made sense to pair it close to the search bar.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <img src="assets/images/results-signup.png" alt="Preference test - signup">
                            <p><strong>Results: Sign Up/Sign In Form</strong></p>
                            <p>About 90% preferred to have the Sign Up/Sign In form as a modal on the landing page. They thought this was more
                                interesting and felt that it was more direct. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <img src="assets/images/results-label.png" alt="Preference test - text editor labels">
                            <p><strong>Results: Labels for Text Editor Icons</strong></p>
                            <p>About 75% preferred to have labels underneath the icons on the top navigation bar of the text editor. They like
                                icons
                                being made clear for them.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Taking these findings into consideration, I polished the mockups and updated their prototypes. You can view the latest

                    <h4 class="project-title">Lessons Learned</h4>
                    <p>Looking back at OmniCloud’s development, there were certain points in the journey that were surprising, yet enlightening.
                        During the discovery phase, I learned that the majority of users’ needs did not always align with those of my client, the
                        stakeholders. To set a compromise between these expectations became an immediate challenge. I learned that one needs to
                        think
                        outside the box and research deeper to address this issue. I learned that by researching and testing early and
                        frequently,
                        your project would be spared from trouble down the line.</p>
            
                    <p> I also learned to embrace iteration, but to also be mindful of deadlines. Iterations debunk our initial assumptions about
                        the
                        “best version” of our product, but they could be time-consuming. I learned that minimizing scope creeps and establishing
                        design systems early in the creative process would save time and avoid missing deadlines.</p>
              
                    <p>Overall, this project helped me become more confident in my research and design thinking skills. Going forward, I hope to
                        refine these skills with complex projects involving teams. My next goal is to learn more about the latest design methods,
                        so
                        that I could implement a quicker, more efficient process to produce meaningful products. </p>
