                        <h3 class="case-study-heading-lg">Problem</h3>
                        <p>Cloud storage apps are known for securely storing
                            digital assets such as photos and
                            documents.
                            But
                            what if you wanted to create and store your morning
                            to-do list? Wouldn’t it be easier if
                            you
                            could
                            create that list all in one app? While there are some
                            apps that lets users edit and share
                            files,
                            other can become overwhelmed and get lost in the app.</p>

                        <h3 class="case-study-heading-lg">Solution</h3>
                        <p>OmniCloud aims to address these concerns by bringing
                            these features together in a simple,
                            no-frills layout. Our major design challenge was to
                            offer users a way to jot down notes,
                            store files, and share ideas in one place. Users
                            wouldn’t have to jump from one app to another.

                            Keeping the client’s requests in mind, I explored the
                            requirements’ favorability in the
                            market
                            through user research. The design process was built on
                            consistent feedback as it focused on
                            bridging the desires of stakeholders and the needs of
                            users.</p>

                            <p>To begin, I wanted to understand the market for cloud storage apps. I explored the current landscape through a

                                analysis, which looked into three major competitors that catered to specific interests. Here are some notable

                            <p>While these findings were helpful, I have only scratched the surface. It was time to dig deeper and ask: who
                                really
                                are
                                these users? What value do they get from using these cloud storage apps?</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>To understand our users better, I interviewed three individuals about themselves, their daily habits, and their
                                experiences with cloud storage apps. The interview style was largely open-ended.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>The pattern that emerged from the interviews was their need to have their files synchronized and accessible in
                                both
                                desktop and mobile. While one did not care for collaboration features, others thought it would be great if it
                                were
                                kept
                                simpler than Google Docs. These insights helped me discover two types of users: the casual user and the expert.
                                The
                                casual user uses one to two main features such as uploading photos, while the expert uses multiple features such
                                as
                                editing and collaborating on files. These findings were laid out into the following personas:

                                see
                                how
                                their needs align with that of our users.

                            <strong>Requirements:</strong>

                                <li>saving content you find on the web (links,
                                    images, videos, etc.)</li>
                                <li>organizing that content using things like

                                Do user and stakefolder needs align? Almost. It depends on the type of user.

                                I realized that the expert user would not only benefit from basic cloud storage app features, but would also
                                prefer
                                to
                                connect with others for real-time collaboration on projects. Given that only a few cloud storage apps offer this
                                set
                                of
                                features, I decided to keep the expert users’ needs in mind while constructing the app.

                                keeping familiar flows. The onboarding process, for example, has been a target of complaints by survey responders. To
                                simplify this, I gave users the option of signing up with their Google and Facebook accounts.</p>

                                viable product (MVP). The primary pages are the landing page and the dashboard. Other core features such as logins
                                and
                                signups are presented in modals.</p>

                                Testers were tasked to do three tasks: signing up for an account, adding a piece of content, and organizing content.
                                Overall, the users found the tasks to be simple and straightforward. A few suggestions came up about adding a
                                tutorial
                                and other convenient interactions such as clicking-and-dragging items into a folder.</p>

                            <p>Before sketching page layouts, I decided to work on the brand identity to figure out the hierarchy of elements and
                                sprinkle
                                content throughout the site.

                                <strong>The origin of the name OmniCloud:</strong>
                                The current ideas for the cloud storage app lean toward becoming a base for storing, creating, customizing and
                                sharing
                                files.
                                Thinking about the words versatility and boundless to describe this app’s capabilities, I searched for words with a
                                similar
                                meaning. There, I discovered the prefix omni meaning “all” and combined it with the nature of this project, the cloud
                                storage
                                app.

                                The name “OmniCloud” could remind someone of the word “omnipotent”, which is often used to describe an all-powerful
                                deity, or
                                “omnificent”, which describes one with unlimited creative power. To describe something of such high regard is to
                                equate
                                it
                                with something robust, reliable and secure.

                                Keeping this and my research findings in mind, I have developed the following:</p>

                                <li><strong>Vision</strong>to see OmniCloud as a popular choice across companies, schools, and collaborative spaces</li>
                                <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>students and professionals from age 18 and above</li>

                            <p>Ultimately, I decided to piece sets of ellipses together and included a logotype with a futuristic font and dual-color
                                scheme. These details reflect OmniCloud’s expertise, professionalism, and openness to evolve as a modern cloud
                                storage
                                application. </p>

                            <p>With feedback gathered about layouts and additional features, I developed high-fidelity mockups for both desktop and
                                mobile views with Sketch and InVision. Using the style guide, I first built a design system to maintain consistency
                                across patterns and elements throughout the site.</p>

                            <h3>2nd Round of Testing: User Flows, Style, and Brand</h3>
                            <p>I conducted the first round of usability tests on three individuals. I asked them to not only sign up for a new
                                account,
                                add content, and organize items, but to also share files and add collaborators. Here were the most notable
                                suggestions:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Did not like having the sign up modal on another blank page</li>
                                <li>Instead of adding a gray overlay on selected files, add ellipses to encourage users to seek more options</li>
                                <li>Menu for mobile looks confusing when it is scattered; stacking it like the file menu window might help with
                                    legibility</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Users were also asked about their general opinions of OmniCloud, its brand and whether they would be motivated to use
                                the
                                app in the future. They felt that the app was simple, intuitive, and professional. Some remarked that they would not
                                need
                                to use the text editor, but would use the app to store files such as photos from their devices. Others who found the
                                editing features helpful would intend on using it again in the future.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <h3>3rd Round of Testing: Preferences for Style and Function</h3>
                            <p>Taking recent suggestions into consideration, I revised parts of the OmniCloud desktop and mobile mockups and
                                conducted
                                another usability test to determine what new users preferred. Using Maze, I sent out a brief preference test with the
                                following design comparisons:</p>
                            <div>
                                <img src="#" alt="Preference test - settings">
                                <strong>Results: Settings</strong>
                                <p>Over 60% preferred to have the settings icons on the top right of the dashboard. The thought that it was more
                                    intuitive and made sense to pair it close to the search bar.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <img src="#" alt="Preference test - onboarding">
                                <strong>Results: Sign Up/Sign In Form</strong>
                                <p>About 90% preferred to have the Sign Up/Sign In form as a modal on the landing page. They thought this was more
                                    interesting and felt that it was more direct. </p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <img src="#" alt="Preference test - text editor labels">
                                <strong>Results: Labels for Text Editor Icons</strong>
                                <p>About 75% preferred to have labels underneath the icons on the top navigation bar of the text editor. They like
                                    icons
                                    being made clear for them.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Taking these findings into consideration, I polished the mockups and updated their prototypes. You can view the latest
                                prototypes here:</p>

                        <h3 class="case-study-heading-lg">Lessons Learned</h3>
                        <p>Looking back at OmniCloud’s development, there were certain points in the journey that were surprising, yet enlightening.
                            During the discovery phase, I learned that the majority of users’ needs did not always align with those of my client, the
                            stakeholders. To set a compromise between these expectations became an immediate challenge. I learned that one needs to
                            think
                            outside the box and research deeper to address this issue. I learned that by researching and testing early and
                            frequently,
                            your project would be spared from trouble down the line.

                            I also learned to embrace iteration, but to also be mindful of deadlines. Iterations debunk our initial assumptions about
                            the
                            “best version” of our product, but they could be time-consuming. I learned that minimizing scope creeps and establishing
                            design systems early in the creative process would save time and avoid missing deadlines.

                            Overall, this project helped me become more confident in my research and design thinking skills. Going forward, I hope to
                            refine these skills with complex projects involving teams. My next goal is to learn more about the latest design methods,
                            so
                            that I could implement a quicker, more efficient process to produce meaningful products. </p>
